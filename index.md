### About this page and myself.

I am Niels Verleysen and welcome to my personal github page. This page is meant as an overview of the different projects that I am working on or that I have finished. These include the repositories for both my theses and different school and side projects. In 2019 I obtained a master's degree in Information Engineering Technology at the University of Ghent and one year later I obtained an advanced master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven. Currently I am looking for work as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer.

## Text generator with Long Short-Term Memory networks

In this project I am making a LSTM network that learns to write text by reading a .txt file. When trained this network can generate new text based on what it has read. Currently the basic system works and I am working on further improvements.

## Thesis: Temporal modeling for safer spacecrafts

![](”https://github.com/VerleysenNiels/VerleysenNiels.github.io/blob/master/images/showcase/temporal-mod-showcase.gif”)

Main project of my thesis. This is a proof-of-concept unsupervised anomaly detection system for spacecrafts, but it can also be used in other applications. This system is based on a LSTM network that learns to predict future observations of the sensors of the system. These predictions can then be used to detect anomalies and report a ranking of the sensors based on how their error. To train and test this system I was able to use one year of sensor measurements of the Mars Express orbiter. In the testing phase the system was able to very quickly detect deviations of single or combinations of sensors and these were reported clearly with the ranking system.
