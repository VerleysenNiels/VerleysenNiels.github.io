                  <p>The release of ChatGPT has been dominating headlines and rightfully so. The latest chatbot by OpenAI is so good, you would sometimes forget you were chatting with a computer. The core technology behind this marvel? Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback! In this blog I explain how this technique can be applied to language tasks.</p>

                  <p>Performing maintenance is critical to keep appliances, vehicles, manufacturing machines, etc. working correctly. By employing artificial intelligence, you can gain better insights in these machines. With these insights you can optimize the performance, ensure quality and even predict when the machine will break down! </p>

                  <p>Did you ever wonder how some intelligent products are so incredibly good at certain tasks? And did you then wonder how you could do this with one of your products? If you did, then you are at the right place, because in this blog we are diving into the world of continuous learning. We’ll discuss what continuous learning is and how this can be applied to almost any product with our handy roadmap. Whether it’s something as simple as a lamp or as complex as a modern car, we’ve got you covered.</p>

                  <p>Earth observation systems generate huge amounts of data. This is a blessing, but without large scale automated data processing and analysis it can quickly become a curse. In this talk I am interviewed by my colleague Daniel about the unique role that data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence play in making NewSpace data actionable.</p>

                  <img src="../images/insights/pcb.jpg" align=”left” class="left"/>
                  <p>Have you ever wondered why your smart home devices are rather dumb when you switch off the internet? Turns out, many of these devices are not as bright as you think. They borrow their intelligence from their ‘cloud’ overlords. Maybe you’re entertaining the idea of making your company’s product smart as well. You might wonder: “Why can’t my device think on its own?” In this blog, we’ll dive into the world of central (cloud) vs local (edge) intelligence and share how we weigh these options when we sketch out a new AI design for smart home applications.</p>

                  <img src="../images/insights/idea.jpg" align=”left” class="left"/>
                  <p>During the 2021 edition of the Innovation days at Verhaert I gave a talk about edge AI in smart homes and appliances; Today’s smart home devices and appliances aren’t really smart, it is the cloud that is smart. This limits the possibilities of your devices and creates privacy concerns. So how can we make our devices smarter to solve these problems?</p>
