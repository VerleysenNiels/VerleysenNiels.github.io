                        <p>In this intra-company presentation on the Sentinel Project, I showcased my role in developing the automated AI labeling toolbox. This tool leverages active learning and AutoML to streamline data labeling, enabling medical professionals to efficiently annotate data for training quality assessment models. These models support rapid, accurate interpretation of biomarker data from Sentinel's wearable sensors, ultimately enhancing early detection of critical health risks like sepsis and delirium.</p>

                        <p>As part of my role at Verhaert, I delivered an internal talk on transformers. The session began with a brief overview of neural networks before delving into the theory and implementation details of transformers. I explained the inner workings of transformers and their applications in various domains, including  natural language processing and computer vision. Additionally, I discussed how we can leverage pretrained models from HuggingFace to enhance our projects for clients. It was an engaging session that explored the power and potential of transformers in the field of AI.</p>
