                  <img src="../images/insights/idea.jpg" align=”left” class="left"/>
                  <p>Did you ever wonder how some intelligent products are so incredibly good at certain tasks? And did you then wonder how you could do this with one of your products? If you did, then you are at the right place, because in this blog we are diving into the world of continuous learning. We’ll discuss what continuous learning is and how this can be applied to almost any product with our handy roadmap. Whether it’s something as simple as a lamp or as complex as a modern car, we’ve got you covered.</p>

                  <img src="../images/insights/pcb.jpg" align=”left” class="left"/>
                  <p>Have you ever wondered why your smart home devices are rather dumb when you switch off the internet? Turns out, many of these devices are not as bright as you think. They borrow their intelligence from their ‘cloud’ overlords. Maybe you’re entertaining the idea of making your company’s product smart as well. You might wonder: “Why can’t my device think on its own?” In this blog, we’ll dive into the world of central (cloud) vs local (edge) intelligence and share how we weigh these options when we sketch out a new AI design for smart home applications.</p>
