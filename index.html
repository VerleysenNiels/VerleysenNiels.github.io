        <h2>About Me and This Page</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! &#128400 I am excited to share my portfolio of side-projects and blogs with you. Currently, I hold the position of Senior Data Scientist at Verhaert, an innovation consultancy company trusted by industry leaders in their respective fields. &#128640 My role primarily revolves around applied data science research for product development, encompassing both physical and digital products. My expertise extends beyond ML algorithms as well, I thoroughly enjoy exploring new domains and creating innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>Here's a fun fact: The digital painting you see was generated using a stable diffusion model that I fine-tuned on pictures of myself! It's an intriguing process that I highly recommend trying out if you have the opportunity. &#128525</p>

              <p>During my studies on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), I implemented the algorithm from scratch and trained agents to play Atari games using the Gym environment. PPO is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability and sample efficiency. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with PPO and understand its inner workings.</p>

              <p> When working with transformers, HuggingFace is an indispensable platform. It offers a wide range of resources including datasets, pretrained models, courses, and more, specifically tailored for transformers. In my pursuit to dive deeper into transformers, I embarked on various projects utilizing HuggingFace to gain hands-on experience. The Reddit TLDR project is one of several projects I created to explore the capabilities of transformers by summarizing Reddit posts.</p>
