            <p>Welcome to my personal github page! This page is meant as an overview of the different projects that I am working on or that I have finished. These include the repositories for both my theses and different school and side projects. In 2019 I obtained a master's degree in Information Engineering Technology at the University of Ghent and one year later I obtained an advanced master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven. I enjoy creating new things, even if they are not always very useful. Currently I am looking for work as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer. </p>

                  <h3>Text generator with Long Short-Term Memory networks</h2>
                  <p>In this project I am making a LSTM network that learns to write text by reading a text file. When trained this network can generate new text based on what it has read. Currently the basic system works and I am working on further improvements.</p>

                  <img src="../images/showcase/temporal-mod-showcase.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                  <p>Main project of my thesis. This is a proof-of-concept unsupervised anomaly detection system for spacecrafts, but it can also be used in other applications. This system is based on a LSTM network that learns to predict future observations of the sensors of the system. These predictions can then be used to detect anomalies and report a ranking of the sensors based on how their error. To train and test this system I was able to use one year of sensor measurements of the Mars Express orbiter. In the testing phase the system was able to quickly detect deviations of single or multiple sensors.</p>

                  <img src="../images/showcase/five_rectangles_bridge.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                  <p>In this project I first recreated the self-organizing kilobot swarm from the WYSS Institute in the MASON environment. This swarm can arrange itself in any given shape, as long as this shape exists out of one piece. The bots build up a gradient field around some seed bots and use this to determine their location. By knowing their location these bots can then determine when they should join the shape. I then extended this system with the idea of bridge-forming, enabling the bots to construct multiple shapes at once. The current bridge-forming principle is however not completely stable, however some ideas are given in the paper to solve this problem.</p>

                  <img src="../images/showcase/lstm-periodic-showcase.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                  <p>Little brother of the main project of my thesis. This is a proof-of-concept unsupervised anomaly detection system trained on a single synthetic signal. This system is based on a LSTM network that learns to predict future values of the signal, which are then used to detect anomalies through a threshold on the loss. Using a synthetic signal allows for testing different aspects and capabilities of the system. The system is able to detect deviations in amplitude and frequency of the signal. It is however unable to detect the decay of a high frequency component.</p>

                  <img src="../images/showcase/qlearning-showcase.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                  <p>As part of my thesis (Reinforcement Learning: with applications to robotic control, 2019) I tested different versions of the Q-Learning algorithm in the Gym environment. With Reinforcement Learning an agent can be trained to do certain tasks by reinforcing good behaviour and punishing bad behaviour. In this case the agent needs to learn to play a videogame like a human, this means that it gets a frame as input and needs to decide which button to press in order to gain points and to avoid losing. In my thesis I then applied this algorithm to a simulated robotic arm in order to make it pick up boxes.</p>

                    <h3>Indoor location tracking in museums</h2>
                    <p>In this group project we applied computer vision to determine the location of a user inside a museum. A camera, either mounted or via a smartphone, sees what the user sees while walking around in the museum. The program then detects paintings and extracts them from the video frame. The ID of the painting can be determined by feature matching. The system knows where every painting is located and can therefore determine the location of the user. To improve the accuracy we then eliminate estimated locations that are impossible, for instance a user cannot jump from one side of the museum to another in a single frame.</p>
