            <h2>About Me and This Page</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! &#128400 I am excited to share my portfolio of side-projects and blogs with you. Currently, I hold the position of Senior Data Scientist at Verhaert, an innovation consultancy company trusted by industry leaders in their respective fields. &#128640 My role primarily revolves around applied data science research for product development, encompassing both physical and digital products. My expertise extends beyond ML algorithms as well, I thoroughly enjoy exploring new domains and creating innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>Here's a fun fact: The digital painting you see was generated using a stable diffusion model that I fine-tuned on pictures of myself! It's an intriguing process that I highly recommend trying out if you have the opportunity. &#128525</p>

                <p>Main project of my thesis. This is a proof-of-concept unsupervised anomaly detection system for spacecraft. But, in general, it can also be used to monitor any system with (a lot of) sensors. This system is based on an LSTM network that learns to predict future observations of the sensors of the system. These predictions can then be used to detect anomalies and report a ranking of the sensors based on their error. To train and test this system, I was able to use one year of sensor measurements of the Mars Express orbiter (provided by the European Space Agency).</p>

                <img src="../images/showcase/qlearning-showcase.gif" alt="Reinforcement learning in OpenAI Gym" class="project-image" />
                <p>As part of my thesis (Reinforcement Learning: with applications to robotic control, 2019), I tested different versions of the Q-Learning algorithm in the Gym environment. With Reinforcement Learning, an agent can be trained to do certain tasks by reinforcing good behavior and punishing bad behavior. In this case, the agent needs to learn to play a video game like a human, which means it gets a frame as input and needs to decide which button to press in order to gain points and avoid losing. In my thesis, I then applied this algorithm to a simulated robotic arm to make it pick up boxes.</p>

                        <p>The release of ChatGPT has been dominating headlines and rightfully so. The latest chatbot by OpenAI is so good, you would sometimes forget you were chatting with a computer. The core technology behind this marvel? Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback! In this blog I explain how this technique can be applied to language tasks.</p>
