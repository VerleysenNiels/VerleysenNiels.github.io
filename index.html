            <p>Welcome to my personal github page! &#128400  As you can see this page is meant as a portfolio of my side-projects and blogs. I'm currently employed as an AI System Engineer at Verhaert, an innovation consultancy company trusted by some of the largest companies in their respective fields. &#128640 My role can be best described as applied datascience research for product development (both physical and digital products), although I work with non-ML algorithms too. I enjoy learning and creating new things, even if they are not always very useful. &#128584</p>

                        <img src="../images/showcase/temporal-mod-showcase.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                        <p>Main project of my thesis. This is a proof-of-concept unsupervised anomaly detection system for spacecrafts. But in general, it can also be used to monitor any system with (a lot of) sensors. This system is based on an LSTM network that learns to predict future observations of the sensors of the system. These predictions can then be used to detect anomalies and report a ranking of the sensors based on their error. To train and test this system I was able to use one year of sensor measurements of the Mars Express orbiter (provided by the European Space Agency). In the testing phase the system was able to quickly detect deviations of single or multiple sensors.</p>

                        <img src="../images/showcase/qlearning-showcase.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                        <p>As part of my thesis (Reinforcement Learning: with applications to robotic control, 2019) I tested different versions of the Q-Learning algorithm in the Gym environment. With Reinforcement Learning an agent can be trained to do certain tasks by reinforcing good behaviour and punishing bad behaviour. In this case the agent needs to learn to play a videogame like a human, this means that it gets a frame as input and needs to decide which button to press in order to gain points and to avoid losing. In my thesis I then applied this algorithm to a simulated robotic arm in order to make it pick up boxes.</p>

                        <h3>Pattern constructing swarm in MASON</h2>
                        <img src="../images/showcase/five_rectangles_bridge.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                        <p>In this project I first recreated the self-organizing kilobot swarm from the WYSS Institute in the MASON environment. This swarm can arrange itself in any given shape, as long as this shape exists out of one piece. The bots build up a gradient field around some seed bots and use this to determine their location. By knowing their location these bots can then determine when they should join the shape. I extended this system with the idea of bridge-forming, enabling the bots to construct multiple shapes at once. The current bridge-forming principle is not completely stable, some ideas are given in the paper to solve this problem.</p>
