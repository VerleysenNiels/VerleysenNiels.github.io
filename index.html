            <p>Welcome to my personal github page! &#128400  As you can see this page is meant as a portfolio of my side-projects and blogs. I'm currently employed as an AI System Engineer at Verhaert, an innovation consultancy company trusted by some of the largest companies in their respective fields. &#128640 My role can be best described as applied datascience research for product development (both physical and digital products), although I work with non-ML algorithms too. I enjoy learning and creating new things, even if they are not always very useful. &#128584</p>
            <p>Fun fact: this digital painting was generated with a stable diffusion model I finetuned on pictures of myself! It's definitely something I recommend everyone with the ability to try out as well! &#128525</p>

                        <img src="../images/showcase/temporal-mod-showcase.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                        <p>Main project of my thesis. This is a proof-of-concept unsupervised anomaly detection system for spacecrafts. But in general, it can also be used to monitor any system with (a lot of) sensors. This system is based on an LSTM network that learns to predict future observations of the sensors of the system. These predictions can then be used to detect anomalies and report a ranking of the sensors based on their error. To train and test this system I was able to use one year of sensor measurements of the Mars Express orbiter (provided by the European Space Agency).</p>

                        <img src="../images/showcase/qlearning-showcase.gif" align=”left” class="left"/>
                        <p>As part of my thesis (Reinforcement Learning: with applications to robotic control, 2019) I tested different versions of the Q-Learning algorithm in the Gym environment. With Reinforcement Learning an agent can be trained to do certain tasks by reinforcing good behaviour and punishing bad behaviour. In this case the agent needs to learn to play a videogame like a human, this means that it gets a frame as input and needs to decide which button to press in order to gain points and to avoid losing. In my thesis I then applied this algorithm to a simulated robotic arm in order to make it pick up boxes.</p>

                        <p>The release of ChatGPT has been dominating headlines and rightfully so. The latest chatbot by OpenAI is so good, you would sometimes forget you were chatting with a computer. The core technology behind this marvel? Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback! In this blog I explain how this technique can be applied to language tasks.</p>
